Welcome to SDSS Computing Studies GITHUB


This is where we can store important files used in helping us work through the Computing Studies Curriculum.  This is an example of a repository, which is a collection of all of the files that are used in the development of a project.  A project may start with a readme.md file, which basically contains all of the information about the project.  The readme is not strictly necessary, but is a feature of the Git that will be prominently displayed when you visit the page.

You can download a copy of the Github desktop to your computer, which allows you to access many of the Github feature without having to use the web interface.

We will be using a piece of software called "Visual Studio Code" this year, which is an Open Source editor that has been developed by Microsoft.  It has the ability to add many extensions that can be useful in programming a variety of different programming languages.

You may also want to use Notepad++ (on PC) or Textwrangler (on Mac) as a different text/code editor.  Both are very functional, but you may find that Visual Studio Code is a bit more advanced and offers more flexibility and features in the long run.
